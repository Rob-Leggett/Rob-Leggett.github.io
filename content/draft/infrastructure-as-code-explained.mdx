Now, let’s get started.

## Introduction

It is good to be aware that there are several ways to spin up cloud infrastructure, these include:

*   Through the Cloud Provider Portal
*   With the Command Line Interface (CLI)
*   Utilising Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Our focus will be on **IaC**, and how that is performed in the Cloud.

## Okay, what terminology do I need to understand before progressing?

### Dev Ops

DevOps revolves around culture, practises and tooling that together increase an organisation's / team's ability to deliver applications and service while allowing teams to remaining in control of their environments and promoting self sufficiency. It is the combination of development and operations which can also be referred as infrastructure management.

### Infrastructure

**Infrastructure** is the foundation or framework that supports a system or organization. In **computing**, information technology **infrastructure** is composed of physical and virtual resources that support the flow, storage, processing and analysis of data.

### Code

Computer _code_ or _program code_ is the set of instructions forming a computer _program_ which is executed by a computer. ... This source _code_ is translated into machine _code_ by a compiler or interpreter so that the computer can execute it to perform its tasks.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) is the management of **infrastructure** (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as **DevOps** team uses for source **code**. ... **Infrastructure as Code** evolved to solve the problem of environment drift in the release pipeline.

Broadly speaking, any **framework** or tool that performs changes or configures infrastructure declaratively or imperatively based on a programmatic approach can be considered **IaC**.

Traditionally, server (lifecycle) automation and configuration management tools were used to accomplish **IaC**.

## What are the benefits?

*   Version Control
*   Code Review
*   Environment Replication
*   Compliance
*   Cost Reduction
*   Speed
*   Lower Risk

The value of IaC can be broken down into three measurable categories: cost (reduction), speed (faster execution) and risk (remove errors and security violations).\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\] Cost reduction aims at helping not only the enterprise financially, but also in terms of people and effort, meaning that by removing the manual component, people are able to refocus their efforts towards other enterprise tasks.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\] Infrastructure automation enables speed through faster execution when configuring your infrastructure and aims at providing visibility to help other teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. Automation removes the risk associated with human error, like manual misconfiguration; removing this can decrease downtime and increase reliability. These outcomes and attributes help the enterprise move towards implementing a culture of [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), the combined working of [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) and [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_operations).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code#cite_note-5)

## What should be avoided?

*   Don't restrict service availability from the various cloud providers

## Where should the technical competency exist?

Without diving into this in to much detail, let's first look at a few operating practises and how they can be an added benefit for **IaC**.

### As a Central Practise?

Far to many times I have seen a central practise take the ownership of the **IaC** across multiple teams, this approach has proven to become a bottleneck and at the same time slow teams down or not enable solutions to be realised in an ideal way as if they were of control of the destiny, it is very important to establish a practise and a set of principle that can help benefit the various teams but also requires the flexibility to adapt and enable the quickly and ever changing cloud provider capabilities.

### Within Individual Teams?

While I am a strong believe in empowering teams to be able to delivery solutions is the best possible way, have many teams operate all differently also is a non optimal practise especially when you have many teams split across your business it can become very messy if you have people shuffling between projects as well as being able to keep track of licenses.

### What does work well?

If you do have a light weight central practise that does not restrict services available across the various cloud providers but

### What roles should be across IaC?

*   Architects
*   Engineers
*   Managers
*   Product

## What IaC Frameworks are available?

There are numerous tool but just going through the most popular they are really broken into 2 categories, generic or cloud native.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to infrastructure management that involves using machine-readable code to define and manage IT infrastructure. With IaC, organizations can automate infrastructure provisioning, deployment, configuration, and management, resulting in increased efficiency, scalability, and agility. In this article, we will explore the concept of Infrastructure as Code, its benefits, and how it works.

What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code is the practice of defining and managing infrastructure through code, rather than through manual processes. It involves using machine-readable files to describe infrastructure components, including servers, networks, storage, and other resources. This code can be versioned, tested, and managed using traditional software development practices, such as version control and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

The IaC approach enables organizations to automate the provisioning, deployment, and configuration of infrastructure, reducing the time and effort required for these tasks. It also allows for better collaboration between development and operations teams, as well as the ability to easily replicate and scale infrastructure as needed.

Benefits of Infrastructure as Code

There are many benefits to implementing an Infrastructure as Code approach to managing infrastructure, including:

1.  Automation: IaC allows for the automation of repetitive tasks, such as infrastructure provisioning and configuration, reducing the risk of human error and increasing efficiency.
2.  Scalability: With IaC, organizations can easily scale infrastructure up or down as needed, without manual intervention.
3.  Consistency: IaC enables organizations to ensure that all infrastructure components are deployed and configured in a consistent manner, reducing the risk of configuration drift and other issues.
4.  Agility: By using IaC, organizations can rapidly deploy and update infrastructure, enabling faster time-to-market for new applications and services.
5.  Collaboration: IaC encourages collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to better communication and alignment between these groups.
6.  Version Control: By using version control tools, organizations can track changes to infrastructure code over time, enabling easier troubleshooting and auditability.

How Infrastructure as Code Works

To implement Infrastructure as Code, organizations typically use a combination of tools and technologies, including:

1.  Configuration Management Tools: Configuration management tools, such as Ansible, Chef, and Puppet, are used to define and manage the configuration of infrastructure components.
2.  Cloud Management Platforms: Cloud management platforms, such as AWS CloudFormation and Azure Resource Manager, are used to automate the provisioning and deployment of infrastructure in the cloud.
3.  Version Control Systems: Version control systems, such as Git, are used to manage infrastructure code, enabling versioning, collaboration, and auditing.
4.  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools: CI/CD tools, such as Jenkins and GitLab, are used to automate the testing, building, and deployment of infrastructure code.

By using these tools, organizations can define infrastructure components in code, rather than through manual processes. For example, a server configuration might be defined in a YAML file, which can then be tested, versioned, and deployed using traditional software development practices.

The IaC process typically involves the following steps:

1.  Define Infrastructure: Define the infrastructure components using code, such as YAML or JSON files.
2.  Test Infrastructure Code: Test the infrastructure code using automated testing tools to ensure that it is valid and functional.
3.  Version Infrastructure Code: Use version control tools to track changes to infrastructure code over time, enabling collaboration and auditing.
4.  Deploy Infrastructure: Deploy the infrastructure using automation tools, such as configuration management tools and cloud management platforms.
5.  Monitor Infrastructure: Monitor the infrastructure using monitoring and alerting tools to ensure that it is performing as expected.

Conclusion

Infrastructure as Code is a powerful approach to managing IT infrastructure that can help organizations to achieve increased efficiency

, scalability, and agility. By defining and managing infrastructure through code, organizations can automate infrastructure provisioning, deployment, configuration, and management, reducing the time and effort required for these tasks. Additionally, IaC enables better collaboration between development and operations teams, as well as the ability to easily replicate and scale infrastructure as needed.

The benefits of IaC are significant, including increased automation, scalability, consistency, agility, collaboration, and version control. These benefits translate into faster time-to-market for new applications and services, improved infrastructure management, and better alignment between development and operations teams.

To implement Infrastructure as Code, organizations typically use a combination of configuration management tools, cloud management platforms, version control systems, and CI/CD tools. These tools enable organizations to define infrastructure components in code, test and version infrastructure code, deploy infrastructure automatically, and monitor infrastructure to ensure that it is performing as expected.

In conclusion, Infrastructure as Code is a powerful approach to managing IT infrastructure that can help organizations to achieve increased efficiency, scalability, and agility. By using code to define and manage infrastructure components, organizations can automate infrastructure provisioning, deployment, configuration, and management, resulting in improved infrastructure management, faster time-to-market, and better alignment between development and operations teams.
