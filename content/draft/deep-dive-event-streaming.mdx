Now, let’s get started.

## What is Event Streaming?

Based on the terminology listed below Event Streaming can be simple seen as:

Streaming data means a constant flow of events, with each containing information about an event (or “change of state”).

## Why should we use Event Streaming?

**Event streaming** is really powerful when you have events that you want to be able to **process** and perform **analysis** in **real-time** allowing your systems to immediately take action.

If you want to explore if Event Stream is the correct architecture choice for your situation, check out a previous article of mine - [Choosing Event Streaming or Messaging for your Architecture](https://robertleggett.com.au/2020/03/02/choosing-event-streaming-or-messaging-for-your-architecture/)

## Okay, what terminology do I need to understand before progressing?

### What is an Event?

*   An **event** encapsulates a **change** in **state** (what has happened)
*   It should be **lightweight** and carry only enough information required about the **change** in **state**
*   An **event** is distributed to notify any interested parties
*   **Events** are distributed through channels such as **streaming** and **messaging**

An example, when a consumer borrows a DVD, the DVD **state** changes from “for rent” to “rented”.

### What is a Stream?

*   A **stream** consists of immutable data, only inserting new events, whereas existing events cannot be changed.
*   **Streams** are persistent, durable and fault tolerant.

### What is Streaming?

*   **Streaming** of data is the **constant** flow of events where each event should contain enough information to reflect the **change** in **state**.
*   It allows for the **processing** of data to occur in **real-time** (data in motion) and is different from the traditional approach for the processing of **static** data to occur (data at rest) at a later point in time, known as batch processing
*   **Streaming** data is unbounded, meaning it has no real beginning and no real end
*   Each **event** is processed as it occurs and is managed accordingly

An example of this can be found in the stock market.

*   When a stock price change, a new event is created containing the time and day, the stock identifier, and its new trade price which in this example is the **change** in **state**
*   Given there are thousands of stocks, and thousands of trades happening every second, this results in a constant stream of data

### What is Processing?

### What is Stateful and Stateless?

## So what are the components that make up event streaming?

## What technology is available for Event Streaming?

### Apache Kafka

### AWS Kinesis

### GCP Dataflow

### Azure EventHubs

## What does this look like with Microservice Architecture?

When combined with microservices, event streaming can open up a whole new set of exciting opportunities. However, in order to appreciate the value of event streaming, it helps to understand some of the known issues with microservices architectures.

One of the inherent challenges with microservices is the coupling that can occur between the services. In a conventional “ask, don’t tell” architecture, data is gathered on demand. Service A “asks” Services B, C, and D, “What’s your current state?” This assumes B, C, and D are always available to respond. However, if they moved or they’re offline, they can’t respond to Service A’s query.

To compensate, microservice architectures tend to include workarounds (such as retries) to deal with any ill effects caused by changes in deployment topology or network outages. This adds an extra layer of complexity and cost.

In an event-driven architecture (i.e., “tell, don’t ask”), the approach is reversed. In an event-driven architecture, Services B, C, and D would “publish” continuous streams of data as events. Service A would “subscribe” to these event streams—processing the facts, collating the results, and caching them locally, ready for the next time they’re needed.

Using event streams in this way opens up the possibility of fully event-driven systems, mimicking more closely how businesses actually work, perhaps even using scale-to-zero functions (or “serverless computing”) more widely.

## Now, what is the future looking like with Event Streaming?

If your organization wants to adapt to future business demands more quickly, then stream processing of events really matters. Streaming architectures can power everything from simple event notifications—for example, sending an alert when a stock price slumps—to real-time machine learning models to detect suspicious trade activity. Even in batch operations, streaming data can improve analytics and business intelligence by inherently connecting specific events with the times they occurred.

Modern stream processing systems such as Apache Kafka can also act as a stateful source of truth about the business. Because they can store and process events—while also holding onto historical data—systems can analyze and aggregate data in real time without reaching out to external data sources.

However simple or advanced the implementation, event streaming can help organizations future-proof their applications. A common benefit realized by Pivotal customers at all levels is their ability to add new features or eliminate problematic ones simply by adding or removing subscribers to a data stream. There’s no monolithic business logic to reconfigure; just microservices to plug or unplug.

In the years to come, the ability to think in events and build applications around them will become ever more important. Apart from the business improvements that go along with being faster, making better use of data, and designing more intuitive user experiences, there are also technologies such as serverless and functions that have the notion of events baked into their cores. The best enterprises will take full advantage of these innovations to build better, more successful applications.
