1.  Code analysis tools: Static code analysis and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools should be used to identify security vulnerabilities in the code early on in the development process.
2.  Access controls: Access controls should be implemented to limit access to sensitive systems and data to only those who need it. This includes multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC).
3.  Continuous monitoring: Continuous monitoring of the environment is crucial for identifying and responding to security threats in real-time. This includes monitoring system logs, network traffic, and application performance.
4.  Vulnerability management: Vulnerability management involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the software and infrastructure. This includes patch management, vulnerability scanning, and vulnerability remediation.
5.  Threat intelligence: Threat intelligence provides insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities. It should be used to inform security decisions and identify emerging threats.
6.  Incident response plan: An incident response plan outlines the procedures for responding to a security incident. It should include clear roles and responsibilities, as well as communication and escalation procedures.
7.  Encryption: Encryption should be used to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit. This includes using SSL/TLS for web traffic and encrypting sensitive data in databases.
8.  Container security: Container security should be implemented to protect containerized applications. This includes scanning container images for vulnerabilities, implementing container security policies, and monitoring container activity.
9.  Security testing: Security testing should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that security is tested as part of the development process. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.
