Business capability maps provide us with a focus on the **what**, not the **how**.

Business capability maps aka business capability models allow us to understand **what** the business does, and **what** it will do to achieve its strategic goals and objectives, while reducing the gap between strategy and execution, making it important to the success of any business.

## Why do we need a Business Capability Map?

Business capability maps allow us to understand **what** the business does, and **what** it will do to achieve its strategic goals and objectives, while reducing the gap between strategy and execution.

Business Capability Map Overview

Business capability mapping presents a number of benefits, they:

*   Create a stable model of **what** the business does.
    *   It is hierarchical and the capabilities tend to be constant.
*   Help prevent organisational silos.
*   Provide an actionable framework between the business and IT.

The basic capabilities of a business (the _what_) tend to remain constant while, in comparison, the way a business implements its processes (the _how_) is likely to change frequently. Thus a capability map makes an excellent reference point for business planning.

The basic principle is that to deliver their business model and strategy, organisations require the ability to do certain things – they require a set of **Business Capabilities**, or competencies, created by having access to a set of tangible and intangible ‘resources’, e.g. skills, technologies and processes.

Changes to _how_ capabilities are implemented do not impact the base model.  Therefore, mapping and planning solutions based upon the stable business capabilities map leads to less change to IT infrastructure over time.

Using a business capability map to connect key strategy pillars to their methods of execution make the business strategy tangible and more visible to the entire enterprise. This leads to more effective and efficient use of technology by identifying and eliminating enterprise-wide redundancies. A capability-centric organization also helps overcome the common problem of organizational silos.  As such, both software and hardware assets may be leveraged, shared, or reused saving costs. The resulting organization is a more agile and adaptable one, leading to faster time-to-market.

Those within the business need to ensure unique capabilities are captured that the entire business requires to operate, and they are clearly understood by all.

They are often captured to be presented to those at the executive level, but I will also demonstrate the importance it plays to cascading layers of the entire business.

## What is a Business Capability Map?

Business Capability Maps simply provide a way to connect the business strategy with the business execution.

*   Capabilities are unique based on the information they require and use.
*   One capability may use or produce certain information that a similar sounding capability may not require or use making them two different capabilities.
*   Similarly, child capabilities should be interpreted within the context of the parent (for instance, two separate capabilities both named Risk Assessment could exist under different parents named Solution Management and Capital Management).

Each capability should have a unique name (usually a noun) and a concise one-sentence definition.

A good way to create a capability definition is to use the following pattern:  **(Capability Name)**: Ability to (actions) on/with (business concepts or business entities) in order to (outcome).

There are two basic types of Business Capability – **Operational Capabilities** and **Organisational Capabilities**.  Operational Capabilities are created by tangible and intangible resources, e.g. technologies, processes, materials, infrastructure, skills and knowledge.  Organisational Capabilities are created by purely intangible resources – the values, attitudes, behaviours, skills, abilities and expertise of the organisation.  They represent the ways that people and resources are brought together to accomplish work – the ‘Ways of Working’.  They form the identity and personality of the organisation.  Examples include the ability to innovate, business agility, ‘psychological safety’ and collaboration.

Many Business Capabilities are general, or “ordinary capabilities”, that are required just to run the business, but others, either individually or in combination, will create a sustainable competitive advantage and/or be core to the success of the organisation – referred to as the organisation’s **Core Competences** (you will also find the terms “Core Capabilities” or “Strategic Capabilities” being used).

Business Capabilities are defined as part of creating a [Strategic Architecture](https://design4services.com/methods/enterprise-architecture/) for an organisation.  And they are realised by the Operating Model, more specifically through the design and delivery of the products and services that they enable.

### What is Business Strategy?

Put simply, business strategy is **a clear set of plans, actions and goals that outlines how a business will compete in a particular market**, or markets, with a product or number of products or services, that gives all people within a company clear goals and supports them to follow the direction, or mission of the organisation.

It **creates a vision and direction for the whole organisation**.

Steps to support success:

1.  Commit to a Strategic Plan. Before diving into execution, it's important to ensure all decision-makers and stakeholders agree on the strategic plan.
2.  Align Jobs to Strategy.
3.  Communicate Clearly to Empower Employees.
4.  Measure and Monitor Performance.
5.  Balance Innovation and Control.

### What is Business Execution?

Business execution is about **having the employees required to support a company's strategy and making sure they are doing what the company needs them to do to achieve its strategic goals**

_**Business capability mapping**_ depicts _what_ a business does to reach its strategic objectives (its capabilities), rather than _how_ it does it (its business processes). Business capabilities are the connection between the business strategy and business execution.

## Why is it important in Enterprise Architecture?

The image above demonstrates how business capabilities bridge the gap between the strategic objectives (what) and the business processes (how). Enterprise and business architects model business capabilities and then assess the degree to which the capability is fulfilling its strategic objectives which may be impacted by things like available capacity, materials, expertise, and technology. They may also model business capabilities that don't yet exist but are needed in order to meet future business objectives thus creating a roadmap for capabilities which must be built out.  Each capability should have a unique name (usually a noun) and a concise one-sentence definition. A good way to create a capability definition is to use the following pattern:  **(Capability Name)**: Ability to (actions) on/with (business concepts or business entities) in order to (outcome). **Customer Management:** Ability to capture, process, analyze, and report on all customer information related to an individual or organization that does, has done, or plans to do business with the company. (Note: Customer Information is an entity documented in the business concept model) Capabilities are defined in a hierarchy. The process of decomposing capabilities helps ensure that capabilities are non-overlapping and unique.

## How to develop a Business Capability Map in an Agile manner?

If you architecture and engineering crafts are separate this will help bridge the gap and align the strategies and execution they plan out.

**Uniqueness.**  A Business Capability is unique and well bounded.  It does not overlap with another capability and is not repeated within the model.  To give an example, Case Management might only appear once in the model, but within the operating model, there will be several instances, associated with the management of different types of case, e.g. customer complaints, claims, etc.

**Stability.**  The Business Capabilities required by a business are relatively stable compared to how things are done, only changing as a result of changes to the Business Model.  This is because the things a business needs to be able to do changes less frequently than how these things are done.  To give an example, originally you could only check-in for a flight at the airport through a face-to-face transaction. Now you can check-in on-line, or at a self service kiosk at the airport.  The capability to be able to check-in for a flight has not changed, but how you do it has; and very significantly.

**Decomposition.**  A Business Capability is decomposed into lower level capabilities.  These define the more specific capabilities that the higher order capability is composed of.  As an example, “Customer Management” is a very high level capability and there will be lots of views about what it means.  To work through this, it is necessary to break it down further, into lower level capabilities, that are more revealing about the ability required and resolve down to a unique combination of resources.

Building a Business Capability Model is part science, part art.  It is also not a minor undertaking, so it is essential to adopt an incremental and iterative approach to its development, based on the priorities of the business.

In the case of an existing organisation, the first step is to identify the existing capabilities.  This is often approached as a top-down exercise, but it is easier to create a basic framework and then refine this from the bottom up, by talking to the business about the capabilities they require in a particular business area.  Typically this early engagement is driven by the current priorities of the business.

If developing a new Business Model, then the Business Capabilities should be defined as part of the Business Model and Strategy.  If using the [Business Model Canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas), replace the “Key Activities” and Key Resources” with the Business Capability Model view, initially only focusing on the key Business Capabilities required to deliver the Business Model.

A Business Capability has three parts – Definition, Title and Outcome.  A clear, unambiguous and comprehensive definition is key.  It should always be in the form “the ability to do x”.  This is one of the most time consuming aspects, for example, an identified capability may be “Brand Management”, but defining exactly what this means in terms of your own organisation may be far from straightforward.

The label attached to a Business Capability should clearly relate to the definition.  It should be a noun, or compound noun, e.g. Strategic Planning, Customer Management, Marketing, Creativity and Curiosity.

To build a Business Capability Model, identify each Business Capability.  Then group these to provide some logical structure.  Then decompose each Business Capability further to identify specific aspects of the capability, that are unique, well bounded and warrant being called out in their own right.  Note that this often helps to fully define the high level Business Capability, i.e. the identification of the lower order capabilities brings a better understanding of the higher order capabilities.

Having build the basic model, the next step is **Normalisation**.  This is the process of removing any duplication of the Business Capabilities across the model.  Typically, the initial draft of the Business Capability Model will have specific instances of a Business Capability scattered across it (particularly if developed bottom up).  Normalisation is the process of identifying them and bringing them under a single Business Capability in the model.  Note that duplication can exist at any level in the model; and across levels.

The final step is to identify the **Core Competences**, those individual, or groups of Business Capabilities, that provide, or will provide, a sustainable competitive advantage, or are/will be core to the success of the organisation in the future.  Again, the Core Competence will take the form of a title and definition.  This last step should form an integral part of the organisation’s strategic planning process.

In practice, it is extremely unlikely that you will develop a full Business Capability Model at the first pass.  It is more likely that you will either develop an initial high level version, or one focused on specific areas of the business.  Just be aware that you will almost certainly need to re-jig the model as you develop it further, so keep this in mind when applying the model, particularly if using it within a tool to create relationships to other design domains – unless you are prepared for a lot of rework.

It is important that your Business Capability Model covers the entire extended enterprise, including your strategic partners.  Sourcing is again about the ‘how’ rather than the ‘what’.  Do not make the mistake that just because you have already outsourced something, you somehow no longer require the Capability within your enterprise model.  In fact, on building and applying the the model, you may reach a very different view on what to outsource and what to keep in-house.

If your Business Model is predicated on [collaboration](https://design4services.com/concepts/collaborative-advantage/) with others, then you will need to reflect this in the way you build up the Business Capability Model.
