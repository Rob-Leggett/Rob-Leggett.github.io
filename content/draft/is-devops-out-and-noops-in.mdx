Since 2008 when the idea of DevOps began, has been growing stronger year on year.

Since 2011 there has been a slower growing term / concept of NoOps.

I would like to dig a little deeper on this concept to help you understand what it means and how it is being performed through various cloud providers.

## What is DevOps?

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

## What is NoOps?

> NoOps is the idea that the software environment can be so completely automated that there’s no need for an operations team to manage it. NoOps, for “no operations,” is a concept that pushes forward a trend that has been on the march for a decade or more.

## What are Cloud Providers services supporting?

More and more cloud technologies are moving to a NoOps approach

*   BigQuery
*   Dataflow
*   App Engine
*   DataLab
*   Pub/Sub
*   GCP
*   Cloud Functions

## Final Thoughts

Short answer, NO! NoOps is not a replacement of DevOps, in-fact I would say that NoOps does compliment DevOps in some solutions

Typically in IT concepts come in an out of fashion
