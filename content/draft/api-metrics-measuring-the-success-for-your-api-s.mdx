## Why do I need to measure API's with metrics?

## How to measure the success of API's?

Metric Name

Description

Measurement

Interpretation

Latency

The time taken by the API to respond to a request

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower latency is better as it means faster response times

Throughput

The number of requests the API can handle per unit time

Requests per second (RPS)

Higher throughput is better as it means the API can handle more requests

Error rate

The percentage of requests that result in errors

Percentage (%)

Lower error rates are better as it means the API is more reliable

Availability

The percentage of time the API is operational and can respond to requests

Percentage (%)

Higher availability is better as it means the API is more reliable

Response time

The time taken by the API to send the complete response to a request

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower response time is better as it means faster completion of requests

Payload size

The size of the response payload returned by the API

Bytes (B)

Smaller payload sizes are better as they reduce network bandwidth usage

CPU usage

The percentage of CPU resources consumed by the API

Percentage (%)

Lower CPU usage is better as it means the API is more efficient

Memory usage

The amount of memory consumed by the API

Megabytes (MB)

Lower memory usage is better as it means the API is more efficient

Network usage

The amount of network bandwidth used by the API

Kilobits per second (Kbps)

Lower network usage is better as it means the API is more efficient

Concurrent connections

The number of simultaneous connections the API can handle

Connections

Higher concurrent connections are better as it means the API can handle more users at once

These metrics can help provide a comprehensive view of the performance and efficiency of an API, and can be used to identify areas of improvement for the API. It's important to select the most relevant metrics for your specific use case and business requirements.

Metric Name

Description

Measurement

Interpretation

Success rate

The percentage of successful requests out of total requests made

Percentage (%)

Higher success rates are better as it means the API is performing as expected

Time to first byte (TTFB)

The time taken by the API to send the first byte of the response

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower TTFB is better as it means the API is responding faster

Time to last byte (TTLB)

The time taken by the API to send the last byte of the response

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower TTLB is better as it means the API is completing requests faster

Queue time

The time taken by the API to process a request after it has been received

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower queue time is better as it means the API is processing requests faster

Time to connect

The time taken by the API to establish a connection with the client

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower time to connect is better as it means the API can start processing requests faster

Time to first render (TTFR)

The time taken by the API to start rendering the response on the client side

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower TTFR is better as it means the client can start displaying content faster

Cache hit rate

The percentage of requests that are served from cache instead of being processed by the API

Percentage (%)

Higher cache hit rates are better as it means the API is using caching effectively

Cost per request

The cost incurred by the API to process a single request

Currency ($)

Lower cost per request is better as it means the API is more cost-effective

Error severity

The severity level of errors that occur in the API, e.g. critical, warning, informational

Severity level

Lower severity levels are better as it means the API is encountering fewer critical errors

User satisfaction

The satisfaction level of users who use the API, determined through surveys or feedback mechanisms

Survey ratings or feedback

Higher user satisfaction is better as it means the API is meeting user needs and expectations

These additional metrics can provide further insights into the performance and user experience of an API, and can be useful in identifying areas of improvement and ensuring that the API is meeting business goals and user needs.

Metric Name

Description

Measurement

Interpretation

API usage rate

The frequency of API usage over a certain period of time

Requests per hour/day/week/month

Higher usage rates are better as it means the API is being used frequently

API version usage

The distribution of API usage across different versions

Percentage (%)

Higher usage of the latest version is better as it means the API is being used as intended

API response size

The size of the response returned by the API

Bytes (B)

Smaller response sizes are better as they reduce network bandwidth usage

Time to resolve errors

The time taken by the API to resolve errors and return to normal operation

Minutes/hours/days

Lower time to resolve errors is better as it means the API can recover faster from issues

API security

The level of security provided by the API, e.g. authentication, encryption, access control

Security level

Higher security levels are better as it means the API is less vulnerable to security threats

API documentation quality

The quality and clarity of the API documentation, including descriptions, examples, and usage instructions

Documentation rating or feedback

Higher documentation quality is better as it means the API is easier to understand and use

API uptime

The percentage of time that the API is available and functional

Percentage (%)

Higher uptime is better as it means the API is more reliable and accessible

API compliance

The degree to which the API complies with relevant standards, regulations, and best practices

Compliance level

Higher compliance is better as it means the API is more trustworthy and suitable for use in regulated environments

API usage patterns

The patterns of API usage over time, including usage peaks, trends, and seasonality

Graphs, charts, or data analysis

Understanding usage patterns can help optimize the API for different workloads and identify potential issues

API response codes

The HTTP response codes returned by the API, including success codes, error codes, and informational codes

Response code counts or rates

Understanding response codes can help identify potential issues and optimize the API for different use cases

These metrics can provide a more complete view of the API's performance, user experience, security, compliance, and other important aspects. It's important to select the most relevant metrics for your specific use case and business requirements, and to track them over time to monitor progress and identify areas of improvement.

Metric Name

Description

Measurement

Interpretation

API latency

The time taken by the API to respond to a request, including network latency and processing time

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower latency is better as it means the API is responding faster

API throughput

The number of requests that can be processed by the API in a given time period

Requests per second (RPS)

Higher throughput is better as it means the API can handle more requests

API concurrency

The number of concurrent requests that can be handled by the API without degrading performance

Number of concurrent requests

Higher concurrency is better as it means the API can handle more concurrent users

API error rate

The percentage of requests that result in errors or failures

Percentage (%)

Lower error rates are better as it means the API is more reliable and stable

API usage patterns by client

The patterns of API usage by different clients, including frequency, volume, and usage scenarios

Usage data analysis

Understanding usage patterns by client can help identify potential issues and optimize the API for different use cases

API response time by geography

The time taken by the API to respond to requests from different geographic regions

Milliseconds (ms)

Lower response times are better as it means the API is responding faster to clients in different regions

API availability by location

The availability and responsiveness of the API in different geographic regions

Availability percentage (%)

Higher availability is better as it means the API is more accessible and responsive to users in different regions

API usage cost by client

The cost incurred by different clients when using the API, including usage fees and network charges

Usage cost analysis

Understanding usage costs by client can help optimize the API for different business models and pricing strategies

API performance relative to competitors

The performance of the API relative to similar APIs offered by competitors in terms of latency, throughput, availability, and other metrics
