Now, let’s begin.

## What is a Architecture?

Architecture in relation to IT consists of:

*   computers
*   software
*   networks

It is the overall design of a computing system and the logical and physical interrelationships between its components.

The architecture specifies the hardware, software, access methods and protocols used throughout the system.

## What does it mean to produce Architecture in the Cloud?

Just because we move to an era of virtualization, it does not mean that architect become less of a consideration.

But with the Cloud we don't deal with the physical, correct?

In short yes, that is one of the benefits of moving away from physical data center the need to purchase and administer hardware, but there is also a no, and that is you still have a level of control where you data resides and and if you want to make use of single tenancy.

## Who does Architecture in the Cloud?

Ultimately like the solution itself, the Architecture is everyone's responsibility, there are roles that help shape, guide and grow the architecture.

Here is an amusing video describing a Solution Architect, enjoy!

## What should you consider when Architecting in the Cloud?

1.  Security
2.  Cost
3.  Users
4.  Failure
5.  Market Readiness

Most Cloud Providers will have a way to measure the effectiveness of your Architecture, and these will cover a few of the areas mentioned above

*   AWS - [https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc](http://_wp_link_placeholder)
*   GCP - [https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework)
*   Azure - [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/)

## What can you do to grow your knowledge?

Those who know me, know that I am a big fan of the cloud certifications, this is due to the knowledge that you gain from achieving them.

Being hands-on is quite difficult, unless your role expects that, you have to make time to play with the knowledge you gain, this is the most effective way to fully understand, but with that comes an investment in time, the best support is that you can get from work, having a day a week dedicate to learning will make you and your team more effective and more inclined to achieve better results, if you aren't provided that like most organisations then I encourage you to take a few hours a week outside of work playing with the different cloud services, best way to achieve this and keep costs down is to sign up to cloud training providers like that of A Cloud Guru and make use of the playground.
