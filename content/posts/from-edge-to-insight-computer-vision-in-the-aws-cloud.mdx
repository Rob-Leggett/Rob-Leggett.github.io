In an era dominated by visual data, unlocking intelligence from video streams is reshaping industriesâ€”from smart cities and retail to manufacturing and compliance. This guide presents aÂ **generic, AWSâ€‘based reference architecture**, enabling companies to process video at the edge and deliver insights in the cloud securely and at scale.

Now, let's get started.

## **Architecture Overview**

This architecture is designed for:

*   Real-time video ingestion from 100+ cameras
*   On-premise ML inference
*   Event-driven cloud processing
*   Multi-tenant visualisation and reporting

It includes six key areas:

1.  **On-Premise Inference Layer**
2.  **Secure Network & VPN Connectivity**
3.  **Cloud Edge Streaming Platform**
4.  **Identity & Access Management**
5.  **User Portal & Visualisation**
6.  **Centralised Logging & Cost Control**

Computer Vision - AWS Architecture

## **1\. On-Premise: Smart Edge Inference**

Video feeds from 100+ IP cameras are managed by a localÂ **Video Management System (VMS)**, using NAS or SAN storage. AnÂ **AI Agent**â€”installed on a customerâ€‘owned server or VMâ€”handles lightweight inference and metadata publishing:

*   Options include:
    *   **NVIDIA Jetson + DeepStream with AWS Greengrass**
    *   **Containerised inference agents**Â running on virtual platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
*   Capabilities:
    *   Object detection (e.g. vehicles, PPE compliance)
    *   Video redaction or filtering
    *   Event publication (via MQTT, Kafka, or HTTPS)

This layer ensures realâ€‘time processing close to the data source, reducing centralised processing load.

## **2\. Networking: Hybrid Connectivity**

Connectivity is facilitated via a dedicatedÂ **Networking Account**, which provides:

*   **AWS Siteâ€‘toâ€‘Site VPN**Â orÂ **Direct Connect**
*   **Transit Gateway**Â for central routing across multiple accounts
*   Secure DNS viaÂ **RouteÂ 53**, and NAT Gateway configurations

Security includes:

*   **AWS WAF**Â to protect edgeâ€‘exposed services
*   TLS encryption endâ€‘toâ€‘end
*   Proper IAM segregation across environments

### **3\. Edge Streaming Platform (AWS Account)**

This account ingests, routes and enriches video metadata streams in real time.

*   **Ingestion**: AWS IoT Core, Amazon MSK (Kafka), Kinesis
*   **Processing**: AWS Lambda, Step Functions
*   **Storage**: S3 for model binaries, metadata and inference payloads
*   **Model Deployment**: Lambda-triggered updates for edge devices

This account serves as the operational backbone of the vision pipeline.

ðŸ’¡ New ML models can be deployed dynamically to AI Agents from this account.

## **4\. Identity & Authentication**

Authentication and identity management are centralised using:

*   **Amazon Cognito**: Federated login, hosted UI, SSO support
*   **WAF + ALB**: Public protection with per-tenant routing
*   **Secrets Manager**: Secure handling of credentials and API tokens
*   **Lambda@Edge**: Redirection and tenant detection based on domain or claims

This approach enables trueÂ **multi-tenant SSO**Â with separation of identity responsibilities.

## **5\. Portal (Dev, Test, Prod)**

Users access web apps viaÂ **Fargate-hosted portals**Â in isolated environments:

*   Built using React/Next.js or similar
*   Backed by API Gateway + Lambda for scalable interactions
*   Protected by Cognito and WAF
*   Served through CloudFront for low latency

Portal access is dynamically routed based on domain (e.g.,Â `portal.cloud.computervision.ai`).

## **6\. Logging, Observability & Cost Control**

A dedicatedÂ **Logging Account**Â aggregates telemetry from all environments:

*   **CloudTrail**,Â **CloudWatch Logs**, andÂ **X-Ray**
*   **OpenSearch**Â or third-party integrations for search and dashboarding
*   Cross-account S3 logging with access auditing

Additionally, aÂ **Management Account**Â oversees:

*   AWS Organisations and SCPs
*   IAM identity centre and access control
*   AWS Cost Explorer and budget alerts

## **Key Design Patterns**

Here are some essential architectural patterns this design implements:

Pattern

Value

Edge-to-Cloud Inference

Keep latency low by processing at the edge, escalate if needed

Multi-Account Isolation

Minimise blast radius, enable fine-grained governance

Tenant-Aware Auth

Each partner logs in with their own IdP, securely isolated

CI/CD-Ready Portal

Dev/staging/prod allow safe deployment of model and UI updates

Centralised Observability

All logs, metrics, and costs flow into one plane

## **Security & Compliance Best Practices**

*   Encrypted MQTT + TLS connections at the edge
*   IAM role scoping for tenants, regions, and environments
*   Federated SSO with fine-grained attribute-based access
*   VPC flow logs and CloudTrail centralised for forensics

## **Final Thoughts**

This architecture provides a secure, scalable foundation for companies looking to integrate vision AI into their environmentsâ€”whether that's one factory or hundreds of sites globally.

By adopting a layered, multi-account model, you're ensuring the system is ready for enterprise-scale governance, identity, and analytics.
