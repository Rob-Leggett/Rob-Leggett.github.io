## Introduction

Some cloud providers will have more advanced features on their service offerings, while others are added to remain competitive while making the functionality available.

It is important to understand that while these mappings are here to help you identify the equivalent services across the different providers it does not mean they are in feature parody with each other. Therefore, I recommend you to research the services in the providers once you have identified them.

This list focuses on Generally Available Services, massive shout-out to Google for producing the original content which I have taken as the base, and tweaked to be more Cloud provider agnostic.

Any feedback is welcomed to ensure this list is up to date and accurate.
