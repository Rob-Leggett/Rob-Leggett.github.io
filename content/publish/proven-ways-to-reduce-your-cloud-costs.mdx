Now, let’s get started.

## Startup and Shutdown

*   Difficulty to adopt: **1** out of 10 (manual), **3** out of 10 (automated)
*   Limitations: Unlikely suitable for production environments expect for specific use cases, but great for non production environments

If you are running VM instances here are a few important consideration to make before implementing this approach.

Will your data be deleted if you start or stop your instance, meaning is it using a persistent storage or ephemeral?

Does your instances need to be running 24/7 or are there times where they are not used? If you determine you are in a position to start and stop instances this is a simple and effective way to reduce your cloud costs.

AWS does not charge for [STOPPED](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html) instances, GCP does not charge for [TERMINATED](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance) instances, and Azure does not charge for [STOPPED (Deallocated)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/keithmayer/2013/06/19/best-of-teched-2013-windows-azure-new-choices-and-flexibility-for-stopped-vms/) instances. However, you must remember that other resources like persistent disk and static IPs will still incur a cost.

Check out the following guides to help automate this approach.

*   GCP [recommended](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/start-and-stop-compute-engine-instances-on-a-schedule) solution
*   AWS [simple](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/start-stop-lambda-cloudwatch/) and [recommended](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/stop-start-instance-scheduler/) solutions
*   Azure [guide](https://peakup.org/blog/azure-vm-stop-vs-deallocated/)

**This is a proven way where large cost savings can be made.**

## Scaling

*   Difficulty to adopt: **2** out of 10
*   Limitations: Only a subset of cloud services support scaling to zero and solutions must be build to run in those services

If you have times where you are not receiving any traffic, the result is you are paying for resources that you actual don't require.

However rather than scheduling startup and shutdowns, for reasons such as, you have unpredictable traffic flow and/or require the ability to scale up quickly to support an influx of traffic. You can make use of scaling down to zero.

One cloud provider that does this very well is GCP, with a few of their services such as [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/), [App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/the-appengine-environments), [Knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/), and [Kubernetes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler) (kinda) keeping in mind for this you must have at least one node to always be available in the cluster to run system Pods.

Alternatively, you could utilise components such as [Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris), which can scale your idle Kubernetes workloads down to zero, but make sure you check out the [limitations](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris#limitations) first.

For the other cloud providers, AWS and Azure it may be possible, however I haven't seen any official documentation stating it is possible.

**This is a proven way where large cost savings can be made.**

## Spot and Reserved Instances

*   Difficulty to adopt: **5** out of 10
*   Limitations: With Spot instances the workloads need to be flexible, they must be able to support unscheduled shutdowns, there is no guarantee on next spot instance availability. With Reserved instances, you are committed for a period or time, and to make the most of the savings you need to be sure on the capacity you are reserving.

Do you have non critical workloads that can be stopped and commenced at a later time? Spot instances for heavy non critical work loads are actually a better way to control costs. Does your workflow run in containers?

See how you can still use containers with spot instances in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/containers-for-less/) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms) to further reduce your cloud costs. Better yet you can mix these instances with on demand and reserved instances, check out these examples from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/run-your-kubernetes-workloads-on-amazon-ec2-spot-instances-with-amazon-eks/) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/cutting-costs-with-google-kubernetes-engine-using-the-cluster-autoscaler-and-preemptible-vms) for possible strategies.

To better help you understand the different Cloud Provider options available then be sure to check out [this](https://spotinst.com/blog/amazon-ec2-spot-vs-azure-lpvms-vs-google-pvms-vs-ibm-transient-servers/) posting for an overview.

Do you have workloads that you know will be running for a 1 - 3 year timeframe? Will this workload always be running and constant?

If that is the case, then reserved instances are the better option for you to significantly be able to reduce your cloud costs.

Does you workflow run in containers?

Try checking out [this](https://www.replex.io/blog/the-ultimate-kubernetes-cost-guide-aws-vs-gce-vs-azure-vs-digital-ocean) detailed cost breakdown of running on-demand and reserved instances in both managed and non managed containers for each Cloud Provider, and see the cost savings.

**This is a proven way where large cost savings can be made.**

## Serverless

*   Difficulty to adopt: **1** out of 10 (monitoring), **5** out of 10 (optimisation)

Cloud providers such as [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/functions/) all have Serverless capabilities available for use.

While Serverless means more than functions. Functions can be a large contributor to the overall cost, and therefore, will be the focus point for the section.

Are you **monitoring** the functions and the costs you are currently occurring for your functions?

If not, **START**.

Metrics and analytics play a vital role in the decisions we make and when determining an outcome.

[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels), [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tagging.html) and [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/decision-guides/resource-tagging/) all support tagging of the resources providing you a way to track costing of individual functions and help you determine which functions are costing you the most.

Be sure to checkout this great [use case and journey](https://medium.com/foxintelligence-inside/how-we-reduced-lambda-functions-costs-by-thousands-of-dollars-8279b0a69931) post, saving them thousands through optimisation.

Influencing factors such as execution time and resource consumption (memory and CPU), vastly affect the cost.

Example Per Function Costs per Month (as of Dec 2019)

It is evident to see, that the longer a function takes to execute, and the more resources are consumed from the executing function, it can result in significant increases to the costs.

If you multiply this by how many functions you own or require the cost can grow **very** large quickly.

It is also worth noting that the above calculations do not include network data transfer as well as other resource cloud costs that may interact with the functions or vice versa.

However, if you are to take away one point take away **optimising functions is essential**, and can provide great cost savings.

**This is a proven way where large cost savings can be made.**

## Sizing and Type

*   Difficulty to adopt: **1** out of 10

Do you understand the workload you are expected to support? How are you expecting to scale?

Selecting the size and type of the instance you are looking to run is a relatively simple exercise, if you understand what you are looking to support.

Based on the instance type and size you will be allocated more resources of a type over another for example memory over cpu, and you can also choose custom sizes if the requirements of the predefined sizes don't match your workload.

*   By **oversizing**, you are actually underutilisation the instance but still paying for the high cost required to support a more intense workload, as you scale this can increase your cloud costs dramatically.
*   On the other side of the scale, if you **undersize**, you can end up scaling more instance than you may actually require and could have benefited more from a large size requiring less instances and resulting in a larger cloud cost than required.

Ensure you have adequate **metics** to determine you are utilising the instances sufficiently and you will benefit from a more appropriate cloud bill.

For sizing and types [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) all support it.

## Hosting

*   Difficultly to adopt: **2** out of 10

Are you making use of a CDN? Each cloud provider [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cdn/) have one.

Is your website sitting behind it? This is very highly likely, if you are creating website in the cloud.

Where is your website hosted?

Today, many websites are **static** and don't require to be hosted on web servers anymore, as a result, they can be hosted in storage options such as a Bucket sitting behind a CDN distribution.

From a cloud costing perspective this means that the cost of storage in a Bucket is a much cheaper option as opposed to running on a server instance or containers.

Check out the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) and [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) guides on hosting a static website.

## Archive data and use lifecycle policies

*   Difficulty to adopt: **2** out of 10

Is the data retained for longer than 1 month? How often is the data accessed, for instance, is it infrequently accessed such as once a month / once a year?

If that is the case, you could really benefit from archiving your data by moving your data to a different storage class that has a lower storage cost associated to it.

To help automate that you could write a lifecycle policy that will move the data into the specified storage tier based once the desired condition have been met.

For Buckets, [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle), [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) and [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal) all support this.

In this example, referring to the table below, this does not contain **all** the storage tiers, however it does clearly show a massive cost difference and savings that can be made, for instance.

**AWS**

50 TB (50000 GB) Standard Storage \* $0.023 per GB

$1,150.00

50 TB (50000 GB) Standard I/A Storage \* $0.0125 per GB

$625.00

**GCP**

60 TB (61440 GB) Standard Storage \* $0.026 per GB

$1,597.44

60 TB (61440 GB) Nearline Storage \* $0.010 per GB

$614.40

**Azure**

50 TB (50000 GB) Hot Storage \* $0.0253 per GB

$1,265.00

50 TB (50000 GB) Cold Storage \* $0.01373 per GB

$686.50

Example Data Storage Costs per Month (as of Dec 2019)

Additionally, it is important to be aware that frequently accessing the data from the non standard storage tier does incur a higher retrieval cost, and all tiers have additional costing to take into account, such as network data transfer etc.

Also to benefit from the savings it is important to use the different tiers following their recommended use cases.

**This is a proven way where large cost savings can be made.**

## Create a new account per product

*   Difficulty to adopt: **1** out of 10 (create), **7** out of 10 (maintain)
*   Limitations: No support for grouping such as Organisations, best for personal and/or start-ups

By creating a new account per product, you can ensure that you get the benefit from the extra savings offered for the first 12 months.

This however can result in multiple accounts, and managing multiple accounts can become a maintenance overhead.

Therefore, unless you have templated the configuration it is not really sustainable for a large numbers of accounts.

If you want to link all of your free accounts to an Organisation to remove the maintenance overhead, it is not supported or very limited as the accounts must be managed independently to qualify for the Free Tier.

The cost savings come with each cloud provider supplying additional savings, be it free credit such as [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or additional service usage such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) you can have further reduced cloud costs in the first 12 month.

## Conclusion

In short, there are some areas you most likely have addressed, there is also a high probability that you have the ability to optimise and improve on some of these proven ways mentioned through out this post, even to the point of reviewing services you are running in certain Cloud Providers and potentially making a switch, and as a result, you could potential reduce your cloud costs by **thousands** of dollars.

No matter your current situation, I highly recommend you review your current environment and have in place the **adequate metrics** in place to capture areas of **optimisation** in the ever growing services and reap the benefits of a much nicer cloud bill.
