Organizations are utilising cloud solutions at a rapid growth rate. Cloud Providers like Amazon (AWS), Google (Google Cloud), and Microsoft (Azure) have been taking advantage by providing some of the leading cloud platforms in the industry.

There are other available platforms such as Red Hat, VMWare, Rackspace, and others that offer platforms or specialised platforms as well. So with all of these platforms available, there is a strong and rapidly growing need for qualified and educated employees.

[Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/) is a very popular, valuable and highly recommended cloud training provider. Linux Academy provides access to thousands of hours of in-depth courses, labs, flashcards, playgrounds and hands-on training for the various certifications plus many additional skills.

The skills you will learn from the course material and then test in the cloud providers playgrounds will be valuable in concreting the knowledge learned. The training instructors are very knowledgable in their area of focus, and as a bonus, as you progress through the training courses you can accumulate gems which in turn you can exchange for swag.

## Recommendation

I would highly recommend that you have a subscription to one or multiple of the popular instructed led cloud training providers such as **Linux Academy, A Cloud Guru or Plural Sight**, it is best to have a 7-10 days trial with each to determine what you get the most out off, in terms of instructor style, and deep-dive topics that the different services also teach about.

If you are purely focusing on the **certifications**, I also recommend that you also purchase certification practice tests from the other training providers as I have found them to be much closer to the actual exams then the practice tests supplied from the popular instructor-led cloud training providers.

*   For GCP I would recommend the Braincert practice tests, you can find the link for this in a previous post of mine [How I Passed my GCP Professional Cloud Architect Exam](https://robertleggett.blog/2019/09/21/how-i-passed-the-gcp-professional-cloud-architect-exam/)
*   For AWS I would recommend the practice tests from [Jon Bonso](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonjonbonso/) in Udemy or you can additionally follow my approach from a previous post of mine [How I Passed my AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate Exam](https://robertleggett.blog/2018/12/02/how-i-passed-the-aws-certified-solution-architect-associate-exam/)
