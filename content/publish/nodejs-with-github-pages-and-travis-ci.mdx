When trying to find instructions on how to publish into Github Pages, I found that is was not very clear when trying to publish a static site.

I thought it would be good to write a guide on publishing a static site into Github Pages and hopefully eliminate any confusion in trying to do so.

## **Steps**

*   Check your project into Github > master branch
*   Create a Github Token
    *   Click on your profile > Settings > Personal Access Tokens

![Github personal access token Diagram](/blog/nodejs-with-github-pages-and-travis-ci/inline-1.png)

*   Create a **.travis.yml** file to build your project
*   Log into [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and add the **GITHUB_TOKEN** environment variable.
    *   Select the project repository > More Options > Settings

*   Ensure your project repository is enabled

![travis ci enable repo Diagram](/blog/nodejs-with-github-pages-and-travis-ci/inline-3.png)

*   Trigger a build if it does not automatically happen when you enable the project repository
    *   You will now have a **gh-pages** branch created and pushed to Github
    *   You will now have the static site publish to **Github Pages**

## **Let me break it down**

In short all the hard work is done in Travis CI, meaning...

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "lts/*"

install:
  - npm install

script:
  - npm install -g codecov
  - npm run test
  - npm run styleguide:build

after_success:
  - codecov

deploy:
  provider: pages
  skip_cleanup: true
  github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN  # Set this in the Travis CI settings (Repository > Settings > Environment Variables)
  keep_history: true
  local_dir: styleguide
```

**language**: Tells Travis CI that the project is a node project and will make available node and npm

**install**: will run a list of any install commands required before script execution, in our case installing npm dependencies

**script**: will run a list of commands to build our project, in this particular example I am running `npm run styleguide:build` which will build a static site.

**after_success**: will run a list of commands after your build has succeeded

**deploy**: this step is what actually pushes the static site into Github Pages after every build

*   specifying the provider as pages lets Travis CI know your deploying to Github Pages
*   skip-cleanup will ensure that after building the folder you are trying to deploy, it will not be deleted before it becomes deployed
*   github-token ensure you deployer task as enough privilege to push to Github Pages
*   keep-history will ensure that a force push is not performed
*   local-dir is the directory you are pushing to Github Pages, in our case it is the static site that got created from our script command `npm run styleguide:build` earlier

**Congratulations**, on publishing a static site with Github Pages and Travis CI.

## **Benefits**

*   Easy, quick and simple to setup with none to minimal maintenance
*   Code and documentation in one repository
*   Automated deployment of your static site every time you push your code to Github
*   Free hosting of your static site
